<!--# TODO : make title a variable from R, set flatly theme with table of content ; figure out how to call the render with an output name set -->

```{r setup, include = FALSE}

## flowcytometry cleanup steps

Clean \`.fcs\` data by excluding saturated events, retaining singlets and events among densest region to exclude debris

```{python}

print('entered the first chunk')
```

Issues :

-   Looks like there is problem with conda environment; how to enter the correct env?

    -   `error : matplotlib not found..`

```{python}
# | echo: false
# import os ; os.chdir("..") ; os.getcwd() # changing working dir;try global defaults
# os.getcwd()

from analyze_fcs_flowcal import process_fcs_dir # function for complete processing
from scripts_general_fns.g10_user_config import make_processing_plots # Import plotting key

process_fcs_dir(make_processing_plots) # Run the pipeline
# reading .fcs data, beads processing, cleanup and calibration, saving summary statistics and cleaned files

# TODO : test if it works
```
