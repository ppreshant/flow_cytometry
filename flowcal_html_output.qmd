#| echo: false
from analyze_fcs_flowcal import process_fcs_dir # function for complete processing
from scripts_general_fns.g10_user_config import make_processing_plots # Import plotting key

process_fcs_dir(make_processing_plots) # Run the pipeline
# reading .fcs data, beads processing, cleanup and calibration, saving summary statistics and cleaned files

# TODO : test if it works
```
